# ZenMX - CPU Minersuite
Zengate is a CPU Minersuite for different Cryptocurrencies written in VB.net. 
Rather than enter arguments on the command line, or create a batch file, the user can just open the program, choose your desired currency, set your Minergate E-Mail Adress, set the amout of threads and start mining.

This is an alternative for MinerGate GUI. So it's on you which one you wan't to use.

## How To Use
• Open Zengate 

• "Login" with your minergate e-mail adress

• Choose your desired currency

• Set amount of threads

• Start mining

Stop mining by just clicking the Stop button.
Thats it!

INFO: If the program crashes, you may have to kill "minerd.exe" via taskmanager. But this shouldn't happen that often.
